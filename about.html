<p>Thanks for stopping by! My name is Abigail, but I typically go by Abby (and some of my friends call me dabby). I am originally from California, but I recently moved up to Seattle for Ada. I graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a B.S in Molecular, Cell, Developmental Biology with the original goal of becoming a physician.</p>
<p>Throughout my pre-med journey, I had the opportunity to work on a project focused on a passive mobile self-tracking app for veterans with severe mental illness(SMI). During that time, I developed a greater interest in the reach and scalability of tech-based approaches and was motivated to learn more about coding. Fast-forward about a year, and here I am now!</p>
<p>If you are interested in some of the projects I have worked on during my pre-med journey, feel free to browse through the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a class="resource" href="./ADA_Abigail_Choi_Resume.pdf">Resume</a></li>
    <li>The Passive Mobile Self-Tracking study focuses on researching the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of passive mobile sensing for tracking symptoms of patients in treatment for SMI, and develop analytics to predict changes in behaviors and symptoms.

    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>UCLA Students for Community Outreach, Promotion, and Education (UCLA SCOPE) is a community service organization focused on empowering underserved and disadvantaged populations in Los Angeles. SCOPE Patient Health Advocates (PHA) focuses on serving patients through an upstreamist approach to health care. Upstreamism focuses on the social determinants of health, like their socioeconomic or physical environmnet, that may impact an individual's health and overall quality of life.
